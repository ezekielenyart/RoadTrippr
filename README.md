  ## Description
  This application allows those going on a road trip to find locations of interest near themselves, along a route, or near their destination.  Upon selecting locations, they are added to a side list to create a basic itinerary.  The road trippers are able to select destinations ranging from bars and restaurants to shopping centers to centers of faith.  A few quick selection options are available at the top as well.

  ## Installation Guide

  ## Usage Information
  First, click on your starting location to find locations near you.  Then you can click on places along your route or near your destination to find additional locations of interest.  Once you select a location, it is added to the Pit Stops list on the side.  From there, you can plan out how to get to each pit stop on your trip.
